Library Management System using Python

->>>    How to Run the Program

1. Install Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Create a New File: Copy and paste the above code into a new file named library_management_system.py.

3.  Library Management System with GUI

* Step 1: Install Required Libraries

  Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, 
  but you may need to install the json library if you don't have it. You can install it using pip:


                       pip install json
                       pip install tkinter
                       pip install os
                       pip install messagebox


4. Run the Program: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Run it using:


                   python library_management_system.py

->>>  Explanation of the Code

Classes:

1. Book: Represents a book with attributes like title and author.

2. User: Represents a user with attributes like username and password.

3. Library: Manages books and users. It handles loading and saving data to a JSON file.

4. LibraryApp: This class creates the GUI using Tkinter. It has methods to handle registration and login processes as well as displaying books.

5. Data Persistence: The program uses a JSON file (library_data.json) to store users and books. When the program starts or when changes are made (like adding a new user or book), it loads or saves this data.

6. User Interface: The GUI consists of three main frames—login, registration, and the main user interface where users can view or search for books.

->>>  Features Implemented:

 1. User Roles: Users can register and log in; admin functionalities can be added similarly.

 2. Book Borrowing Limits: You can extend this by adding limits based on roles.

 3. Registration/Login: Users can create accounts and log in.

 4. Book Return Policies: Implementing this would require tracking borrowed status.

 5. Search Functionality: Users can search for books by title or author.

 6. Data Persistence: User information and books are saved to a JSON file.

->>> Databases (EXCEPTION CASES WHILE USING DATABASE LIKE MYSQL, SQLITE)

If using databases in library managment system then :

  1. Database Connector: Depending on your chosen database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL), install the appropriate connector. For SQLite, the sqlite3 module is included with Python. For MySQL, you can use:​

                                         pip install mysql-connector-python

  2. Design the Database:

      Choose a Database System: Decide between SQLite for simplicity or MySQL for more robust features.​


  3. Define Database Schema:

       Users Table: Store user information such as username, password, and user role (e.g., admin, member).​

       Books Table: Store book details including title, author, ISBN, and availability status.​

       Transactions Table: Track book issuance and returns with relevant dates and user information.
